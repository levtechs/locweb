Hi {owner_name}, this is Lev calling!

I just wanted to reach out because I had a chance to look at Saucy Brew Works online, and I was really impressed by what you're building in Ohio City. It's exciting to see a new restaurant bringing something fresh to the area!

I wanted to give you a heads up that I've created a professional website for your business - completely free of charge as a way to help local businesses get established online. It's a simple, clean landing page that showcases your restaurant with all the important info: your location, contact details, and what makes Saucy Brew Works special.

The website is already live and ready to go. You can check it out at:
https://locweb.ai/businesses/Saucy%20brew%20works/

It's designed to help more people in the area discover your restaurant and get the information they need to visit. No pressure at all - I just wanted to make sure you knew about it and had the chance to see it.

If you have any questions about the site or want to make any changes, just let me know - I'm happy to help! And if there's anything else I can do to support your business, I'm here.

Thanks so much, and best of luck with Saucy Brew Works!
