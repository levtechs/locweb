PRICING:
"One-time setup fee is $45, then $5/month covers hosting and keeping everything up to date. Super affordable and straightforward."

HANDLE OBJECTIONS / CLOSE:
"I can have this live with your own domain this week if you're interested. No pressure at all — but I'd love the opportunity to help Halfway Inn stand out online."
