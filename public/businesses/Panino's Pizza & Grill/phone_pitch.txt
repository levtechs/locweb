Hi [Business Owner Name], this is Lev calling. I noticed your business Panino's Pizza & Grill on S Orange Ave and I wanted to reach out.

I've been looking at your online presence and honestly, with a 4.1-star rating from over 400 reviews, it's clear you know how to take care of customers. Your customers rave about the New York style pizza and great value - that's impressive!

I specialize in helping local businesses like yours get a professional website that actually converts visitors into customers. I built a demo website for you FOR FREE to show what I can do, and I'd love to get your feedback on it.

You can see it here: https://locweb.vercel.app/web/paninos-pizza-grill

Here's what I offer: I set up a custom domain for your business (like www.paninospizza.com) and handle all the ongoing maintenance for just $45 one-time setup plus $5/month. This keeps your site running smoothly without you having to worry about anything.

I'm confident this could help bring in more customers, especially with how great the reviews are - but I wanted to show you first before discussing further.

Would you be open to taking a quick look at the demo and let me know what you think? I can have it live with your own domain this week if you're interested.

(If interested: Great! Let me know what domain you'd like to use and I'll handle everything.)

(If not interested: No problem at all! I understand. I'll send you the link so you can take a look anytime. Thanks so much for your time!)
