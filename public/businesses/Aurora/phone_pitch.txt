Hi, this is Lev calling. I'm a web developer who specializes in helping local businesses get professional websites.

I came across Aurora while researching local restaurants in Richmond, and I have to say - your place sounds fantastic! Hosting Mix Martial Arts events AND running a damn good restaurant - that's a unique combination that clearly shows you know how to create an exciting experience for your customers.

I actually built you a FREE demo website to show what I can do for Aurora. It's live right now at https://locweb.vercel.app/web/aurora - you can check it out whenever you have a moment.

What I offer is simple: I set up a custom website for your business with your own domain name, and I handle all the ongoing maintenance for just $45 one-time setup plus $5 per month. This includes keeping everything updated, secure, and running smoothly.

I can have this live with aurora.com or whatever domain you choose within the next few days if you're interested.

No pressure at all - I just wanted to offer this as a way to help more local businesses in the area have a strong online presence.

Let me know what you think - would you be interested in seeing more, or would you prefer I follow up another time?
