Hi, this is Lev calling. I'm a web developer who creates professional websites for local businesses.

I came across El Burrito Mexicano while researching local spots, and I have to say—your 4.6-star rating with 126 reviews is impressive! The reviews are full of customers raving about your breakfast burritos and authentic Mexican food. It's clear you know how to take care of your customers.

I wanted to reach out because I've created a FREE demo website for your business to show what I can do. It's a professional, mobile-friendly site that showcases your business information, photos, reviews, and hours. You can see it at: https://locweb.vercel.app/web/el-burrito-mexicano

Here's what I offer: I can set up the website with your own custom domain, and I handle all the ongoing maintenance for just $5 per month. The one-time setup fee is $45.

I can have this live with your own domain this week if you're interested. There's no pressure at all—I'm just offering a service that helps local businesses like yours stand out online.

Would you like me to send you the link to preview the demo website?
