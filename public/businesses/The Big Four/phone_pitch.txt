Hi! My name is Lev, and I'm a local web developer. I'm reaching out because I came across The Big Four online and noticed your bar has an impressive 4.6-star rating from 123 reviews. That's really impressive! Your customers clearly love the friendly atmosphere and great drinks you offer.

I specialize in helping local businesses like yours build a professional online presence, and I've actually created a FREE demo website for The Big Four to show you what I can do. The demo is already live and showcases your business with your photos, hours, location, and those great customer reviews.

The website includes:
- A professional landing page highlighting your bar
- Your business hours, address, and contact info
- Photo gallery showcasing your establishment
- Customer reviews section
- Easy mobile navigation

I'm offering to set this up with your own custom domain for just $45 one-time setup fee, plus $5/month for hosting and ongoing maintenance. This keeps your site running smoothly and keeps your information fresh for customers searching online.

I can have this live with your own domain this week if you're interested. There's no pressure at all - I just wanted to share what I've built for you. Would you be open to seeing the demo website, or is now a better time to chat?
