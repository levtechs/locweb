BUILD RAPPORT:
"Your customers clearly love the food here - those reviews are impressive! With a 4.4-star rating from over 1,200 reviews, it's clear you know how to take care of customers."

PRESENT THE OFFER:
"I actually put together a free demo website for Little Saigon to show you what I can do. It's already live and ready for you to see."

PRICING:
"It's $45 one-time setup plus $5/month for hosting and maintenance. That's it - no hidden fees."

CLOSE OR FOLLOW-UP:
"If you're interested, I can have this live with your own domain this week. Or if you'd rather think about it, no problem at all. Can I answer any questions for you?"

HANDLING OBJECTIONS:
