Hi [Owner Name], this is Lev calling. I noticed you own Baba Yega on Grant St in Midtown Houston.

I wanted to reach out because I run a local web development service, and I created a free demo website for your restaurant to show what I can do.

I spent some time researching Baba Yega, and I was really impressed. Your customers clearly love the food here - with a 4.4-star rating and over 1,300 reviews, it's clear you know how to take care of customers. The reviews mention your breakfast buffet, the fresh food, and the friendly staff - sounds like you've built something special.

I put together a demo website at: https://locweb.vercel.app/web/baba-yega

It includes your business info, photos, those great reviews from Jake M., Briana Ramirez, and Stephen T, and a clean professional design. All using the local photos that show off your space.

What I do is help local businesses like yours get set up with a professional website using your own custom domain. I handle everything - the setup, hosting, and ongoing maintenance. It's a one-time $45 setup fee plus $5 per month.

I can have this live with your domain this week if you're interested. No pressure at all - I just wanted to show you what I've put together and leave the door open if you ever want a professional web presence.

Would you like me to send you the link so you can take a look?
