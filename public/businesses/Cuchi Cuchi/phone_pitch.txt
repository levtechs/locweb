Phone Script for Cuchi Cuchi

Hi, this is [YOUR NAME] calling. I noticed your restaurant Cuchi Cuchi on Main Street in Cambridge, and I have to say, with a 4.5-star rating and over 800 reviews, it's clear you know how to take care of your customers!

I run a small web development service, and I noticed that many local businesses don't have a proper online presence. I wanted to reach out because I built a free demo website for Cuchi Cuchi to show what I can do.

You can see it at: https://locweb.vercel.app/web/cuchi-cuchi

The site includes your location, hours, photos, and those great customer reviews. It's designed to help more people find you and learn about what makes Cuchi Cuchi special.

I'm offering to set this up with your own custom domain for a small fee - just $45 one-time setup, then $5/month for hosting and maintenance. That covers everything - domain setup, updates, and ongoing support.

I can have this live with your own domain this week if you're interested. There's no pressure at all, but I think it could really help bring in more customers.

Would you like me to send you the link so you can take a look?
