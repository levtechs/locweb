PHONE PITCH SCRIPT - Union Hotel Brooklyn

OPENING:
"Hi, this is Lev calling. Is this the owner or manager of Union Hotel Brooklyn?"

ESTABLISH RAPPORT:
"I wanted to reach out because I noticed your business here in Brooklyn and I think you deserve to have a strong online presence."

PERSONALIZED DETAIL:
"With your convenient location near public transit and some great feedback from guests about the friendly staff and nice rooms, you're clearly doing something right."

PRESENT THE OFFER:
"I actually built you a FREE demo website to show you what I can do. It's already live and ready for you to see - it showcases your hotel, the photos, your reviews, and all your business information."

WEBSITE URL:
"You can see it at: https://locweb.vercel.app/web/union-hotel-brooklyn"

EXPLAIN THE SERVICE:
"This isn't just a template - I build custom websites for local businesses. The service includes setting up your own custom domain, so instead of that Vercel URL, you'd have something like UnionHotelBrooklyn.com."

PRICING:
"And it's very affordable - just $45 one-time setup fee to get your custom domain connected and the site live, then $5 per month for ongoing hosting and maintenance. That's it."

CLOSE OR QUALIFY:
"I can have this ready for you by the end of the week if you're interested. What do you think?"

IF INTERESTED:
"Great! I'll need your preferred domain name, and I'll take care of everything. I'll send you the details over email."

IF NOT INTERESTED:
"No problem at all. I understand. I'll send you the website link anyway so you can see what it looks like. If you ever change your mind, I'm here to help."

THANK THEM:
"Thanks so much for your time today. Have a great day!"
